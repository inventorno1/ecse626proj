# ECSE 626 Statistical Computer Vision - Final Project

This Git repository contains the code developed for the final course project, replicating the paper [*Generating Realistic Brain MRIs via a Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model*]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08034](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10758344/)) by Peng et al.

We provide a brief explanation of each folder:

* `common` - this contains the code for preprocessing, data loading and sampling, as well as utils and scripts for data cleaning, downsizing and the code for evaluating the MS-SSIM metric.
* `experiments` - this contains the model training code for each experiment conducted as part of the iterative development process; `experiment14` contains the final replication model and associated code for generating synthetic MRIs and producing t-SNE plots.
* `notebooks` - this contains several Python notebooks used for exploring the available datasets, designing the model architecture and index sampling, and investigating the samples generated by the trained models in our experiments.

## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge HuggingFace for their [`UNet2DConditionModel`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/api/models/unet2d-cond) that we used for initialising our models and the [MRIAnatEval Git repository](https://github.com/jiaqiw01/MRIAnatEval/tree/main) for their MS-SSIM evaluation code.
